      The AI Maturity Model is a framework used to assess an organization's
      level of AI adoption and integration across different stages. It helps
      stakeholders understand where their organization stands and what steps are
      needed to advance AI capabilities.

            - 1. Awareness: The organization recognizes AI as a key area of potential but lacks a clear strategy or significant investment.
            - Key Characteristics:
            - Awareness of AI technologies and trends.
            - High-level discussions on AI
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Is hyperscale a level of the AI maturity model?
        answer: >-
          The AI maturity model includes the following models, awareness,
          active, operational, and systemic. Hyperscale isn't a level of the
          maturity model
      - question: >-

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Explain how L1 Regularization differs from L2 Regulaization.
        answer: >-
          L1 Regulaization is a method that encourages sparsity in models-used
          to reduce complexity and prevent overfitting while L2 Regularization
          is method that discourages large model weights-helps generalize and
          stabilize training.
      - question: Why is Interpretability important in AI?
        answer: ' Interpretability is important for understanding a model''s internal logic which is necessary for for trust and debugging in AI systems.'

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >-
          Which technique helps ensure a model is robust and not overfitting by
          splitting the data multiple times into training and validation sets?
        answer: >-
          Cross-validation. It systematically uses different portions of the
          dataset as training and validation subsets, providing a more reliable
          assessment of model performance.
      - question: >-
          What type of model learns the boundary between classes and is
          typically used for classification tasks where accurate prediction is
          key?
        answer: >-
          A Discriminative Model. It focuses on learning how to distinguish
          between classes rather than generating the data itself.
      - question: >-
          Which metric is especially useful when dealing with imbalanced data
          because it combines both precision and recall?
        answer: >-
          The F1 Score. It provides a single measure that balances precision
          (how many selected items are relevant) and recall (how many relevant
          items are selected).

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >-
          Which stage of the AI Maturity Model is characterized by recognizing
          AI’s potential but having minimal experimentation, limited strategy,
          and lack of significant investment?
        answer: >-
          Awareness (Stage 1). At this level, the organization has high-level
          discussions about AI but little concrete action or investment, with
          only minimal pilot projects or experimentation in place.
      - question: >-
          At which stage are AI models deployed in production environments, with
          best practices established for governance, monitoring, and continuous
          improvement?
        answer: >-
          Operational (Stage 3). Here, AI applications are successfully moved
          into day-to-day operations. Models are actively monitored and refined,
          providing tangible benefits and insights.
      - question: >-
          Which stage involves AI fully embedded in the organization’s culture
          and strategy, driving innovation, pervasive automation, and creating a
          clear competitive advantage?
        answer: >-
          Transformational (Stage 5). In this phase, AI underpins business model
          innovations, data-driven decision-making permeates all levels, and
          continuous AI-driven improvements become second nature.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >-
          Which term describes AI that creates new content such as text, images,
          or audio?
        answer: >-
          Generative AI (GenAI). It refers to systems capable of producing novel
          outputs that resemble the data they were trained on, such as text,
          images, or music.
      - question: >-
          What is the process of using a trained model to make predictions
          called?
        answer: >-
          Inference. This stage involves feeding new data into a model so it can
          generate predictions or labels based on what it has learned during
          training.
      - question: >-
          What do we call the phenomenon where a model generates information
          that sounds plausible but is actually incorrect or nonsensical?
        answer: >-
          Hallucination. This occurs when an AI model provides inaccurate or
          fabricated outputs, despite maintaining coherent structure and style
          in its response.
